B-minor Compiler in C
This repository showcases a custom compiler for the B-minor language, developed collaboratively by a small team using the C programming language. The compiler implements the key stages of compilation—lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic checks, and code generation—to transform B-minor source code into executable output.

Project Highlights
Lexical Analysis
Converts B-minor source code into a stream of tokens, handling identifiers, keywords, and symbols.

Parsing & AST Construction
Uses a grammar-based parser to validate syntax and build an internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the program structure.

Semantic Checks
Ensures correct variable declarations, type consistency, and function usage before code generation.

Code Generation
Translates the validated AST into intermediate or final machine code, supporting a basic instruction set for experimentation.

Collaborative Development
Version Control & Code Reviews
Employed Git workflows and peer reviews to maintain clean, well-documented code.

Task Breakdown & Role Division
Distributed tasks among team members—ranging from designing the parser to optimizing code generation—and regularly synchronized progress.

Testing & Debugging
Emphasized robust testing to catch errors early, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance profiling.
